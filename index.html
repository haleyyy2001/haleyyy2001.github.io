    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to my webpage! I'm <strong>Huilin Tai</strong>, a fourth year bechlor student in Statistics and Computer Science at McGill University. I specialize in machine learning and data science, with a strong foundation in programming languages like Python, Java, C, R, and Ocaml.
 
        </p>
        <p>
             My research journey has been a path filled with diverse and enriching experiences. It spans from theoretical computer science, with a focus on algorithm design in communication theory and the exploration of replicability in agnostic learning, to the practical application of machine learning in visual odometry, cell profiling, and spatial gene expression prediction. Additionally, my experience in statistical modeling for immunology research and survival analysis strengthened my skills in developing robust analytical frameworks and gave me opportunities to collaborate with brilliant researchers across various fields.
        </p>
        <p>
           
      I also actively participate in academic support as CS-helpdesk tutor and course assistant for courses such as Algebra, Probability, and Statistical Computation. This webpage is a glimpse into my academic and research interests - a space where I share my explorations and experiences in the captivating world of data and computation.
